Information:

PiggyBank is a personal money management app that was designed using the 
kivy module. It allows the user to form a budget, make goals, and input
their revenues and expenses in order to meet their future goals and stay
in financial health. Read the design documents for more descriptions.

This program has the potential to be able to run on android
operating systems. For my purposes, it currently runs on windows, but
could also be run on other operating systems.

#######################################################################
To Run the Project, do these steps:

1)Download and install Kivy version 1.4.1
from this link:

http://kivy.org/#download

2)Move all the pictures and the piggybankData files
to this path on your computer:

C:/Users/Public/Documents/

(if you dont have this directory simply manually change
the file path of all the pictures and data file in
my code)

3)If you would like to start the program with some
data to work with, change the name of the 'piggbankData (SAMPLE)'
file to just piggybankData and then run the program (this is
to replace the original empty piggybankData file). Otherwise,
the empty piggybankData file included will load.

4) Finally, to run the program, right-click the Piggybank.py file
and select open with --> kivy (you will have to locate kivy
on your computer)
